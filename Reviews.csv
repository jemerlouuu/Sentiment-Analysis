My husband and I couldn't get enough of the chicken she made.  When I asked her what amazing marinade was on it, she said it was olive oil and this seasoning- that was it!. Her brother, who's a chef, recommended it.  I went to 4 different stores looking for it. It never dissapoints. If I need a quick dinner, I take an 8 piece cut-up chicken, pour a little olive oil over it, rub it in, then sprinkle the rotisserie seasoning over it (maybe 1-3 tbsp), rub that in, too, and that's it. No salt and pepper is needed.  Sometimes I cut up onions and put them in the bottom of the pan. I bake everything at 375, covered, for an hour, or until I see it's done, then uncover it to let it brown...best chicken, ever! And the seasoning is kosher, so it's perfect for Shabbos chicken.  This week I put fingerling potatoes and sliced onions in the bottom of the pan, tossed them with a little garlic powder, olive oil, salt and pepper, then put chicken on top and seasoned like I mentioned above, letting some of the rotisserie seasoning fall on the potatoes....it was wonderful!"

I'm not a coffee guru...I can't really go in depth about the flavors, aromas, depth, etc....I can tell you that with Lavazza Cafe Espresso i get a palpable caffeine jolt from a 14 gram double espresso extracted over 20 seconds on my gaggia. Not really fond of the taste. I use Cafe Espresso for iced espressos and americanos. I can sort of taste some chocolate and nutty flavors, it does have a bit of a sweet taste, but it seems to have a lingering bitterness. Lavazza In Blue has a cleaner aftertaste and is more chocolatey. In Blue is a bit smoother as well. Illy Is my favorite, clean after taste, not bitter, smoother than both. Plus it seems to have a bit more caffeine kick...but i think that's just mental or maybe because i drink Illy as a straight shot. If you don't mind spending the money, I would buy Illy. If you find it ludicrous to spend $12 on 8 ounce coffee, which i doubt since you probably have a nice machine if you are reading this, I would buy Lavazza In Blue (i can get it for $8 at World Market). If you just want a preground espresso to make coffee drinks, or iced drinks and don't want to spend too much nor buy a burr grinder and grind your own, i would get the Lavazza Cafe Espresso. Still waiting to try Oro and Illy Dark roast.<br />Lavazza Cafe Espresso would get 3.5/5 from me. In Blue would get 4/5, Illy 4.5/5."

My journey started with Nescafe instant when I was a teen, progressed to Starbucks (can't handle the burnt aftertaste), Peets, Green Moutain,etc, found temporary nirvana with Lavazza which I still have time to time, and found permanent nirvana with the Illy brand. The espresso is foamy, smooth, has a wonderful body and just plain delicious. It prompted me to invest in a Gaggia espresso machine just so I can make it at home everyday, and it has become a morning ritual. I enthusiastically recommend this coffee (preferably the medium grind, not the dark grind) if you are a true coffee lover."

An ultrafine, delicate grind, almost like baby powder, with no waste.  Just pure concentrate of perfect coffee.  I do not work for Illy or Amazon, but simply love my morning cup.<br />Anyway, if you have struggled to find the perfect coffee, as I have, look no further.  In my opinion, this is the most consistantly delicious coffee I've ever had. It comes pressurized in nitrogen I believe, to assure it's freshness.  It is very potent, as the fine grind is intended for use in an espresso maker.  I however, use it in my drip coffee maker with spring water and a paper filter, at about two-thirds the usual strength of a standard drip grind.  Buy some for you, or as a gift for your favorite coffee addict friend. Enjoy!!"

My friend used it in a drip coffee maker and I couldn't believe how smooth it was, whether the scoop as level or heaping. Stronger maybe, but just as smooth. Moved on to Italy and would only hit coffee bars with the Illy insignia. Could only find it in the Italian North End in Boston, nowhere else. Finally, finally, it started showing up at Whole Foods and I started to buy it again. I've had Kona, I've had Jamaican Blue Mountain- they don't hold a candle to Illy. I use the expresso fine grind in my auto drip. I just use a paper filter and let it go a few minutes over the finished brew alarm because it's so finely ground, it's a slow drip. But it's worth it!

I personally liked Lavazza taste better.<br /><br />Illy makes grind especially for Stovetop Moka Maker which I used. Apparently it is designed to be completely filtered out  - so there is no tiny bits of grounded coffee in the final product and no powder left in cup when it is empty. For some reason I do like these little pieces in the mouth (probably it is not good for teeth). Lavazza makes just one standard ground coffee which in finer than Illy's Moka version."

They lack the fat of popcorn (except for the air popped corn which is not worth the effort).  They have a certain richness from baking, a taste which ties it right back to the beer from which it derived its malty goodness.<br />These pretzels are great in another way: you can only eat so much at any one sitting.  They take a certain effort to eat, unlike chips, so there's no danger you will eat the whole box.<br />My recommendation before eating is to part-open the bag and then break all the pretzels.  The reason is two fold: you get a variety of shapes and sizes, plus they are much easier to eat.  If you chomp into a whole pretzel, you will discover that you had dental problems that you never knew you had.  So, better not 'test' yourself and just give them a satisfying and productive bash in the bag before eating.  Enjoy..."

I grew up preferring Strawberry, then Vanilla, and, lastly, chocolate.<br /><br />Then when I was 35, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Switzerland. What a treat that was! Lining the main boulevards were small confectionery shops filled with cocholates the likes of which I had never, ever laid eyes upon. A tiny box of chocolates that would be about 5 inches square and hold 12 pieces of candy cost around $30. But I had no idea that Chocolate could taste so exquistely good or look so beautiful. Little candies with 3 layers of chocolate in various flavors topped with small green candy looking twigs, or hearts, or diamond shapes.<br />Truffles made with plain chocolate or all different types of liquors. If I could have afforded it, I would have eaten myself into the size of a blimp. And the sales people were so delightful, always reminding me that this box was made Today and was meant to be eaten TODAY or it would get stale. I thought about our boxes of chocolate that sit on the shelves for weeks or months and winced. Thankfully, lots of walking was required to see the sights and I was able to eat what I could afford and still not gain! It was like Heaven.<br /><br />But then, back to the States we came. Hersheys just didn't cut it anymore. So I began taste testing what I could find locally always recalling the vendors' words ""that chocolate was made today and is to be eatenn today."" I tried Truffles, I tried mixed boxes whose photos made them LOOK LIKE the insides of the tiny little boxes in Switzerland. But nothing measured up.<br /><br />One day, I was in a local store and sighted these Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. It was my turn to bring treats to a group I go to on Thursdays. The chocolates were on sale and I had noted that the Belgian chocolates I had tried did seem fresher than the others, and tasted better than other brands shipped in Stateside. So I bought two boxes and trooped off to my meeting.<br /><br />As Soon as I had put the chocolate out, I checked to make sure that no one else had brought chocolate as a treat. Nope. Then I took one and ambled away to give them a taste. I wanted to make certain I hadn't bought something awful. So with my back turned to the group, I tried out a piece. I popped the whole thing in my mouth and went through my usualy routine for checking chocolate. I let the piece of candy just lay on my tongue for about 25 seconds until it had softened up and then began lightly and politely sucking on the chocolate. Oh my. It was fresh and had a delightful sweet chocolate taste very similar to the Swiss Chocolate I so loved. In fact, this was just a bit creamier. With little time to spare, I went ahead and bit into the piece expecting solid chocolate. But no, there was a soft inner core of ever sweeter, softer, creamier, fresher, chocolate in the center. I was Delightfully Surprised. Hating to hurry, I went ahead and chewed the piece up so that I could join the group.<br /><br />But my what an experience. I found myself going back to the counter several times during the afternoon, to get another piece of that chocolate I had brought. I urged the others to try it and each one was also very impressed with this chocolate. Where DID you get these? Were they terribly expensive? How long do they keep? Can I put them in my candy jar or will they melt? The SeaShells were an overwhelming success. I shared that I got them at the local pharmacy on the corner, that they were currently on sale, best to eat them as soon as possible, but they will keep in the freezer without problem for a year, and, yes you should be able to keep them in the candy jar as it was then winter here in Arizona, but I would not put them in a jar during the summer. I have found that even with air conditioning, delicate chocolate does not hold up well out of its box when it is hot. Somehow the candies sense the outside heat and their insides get really old and stale and melt. Ugh. Best to keep them in the fridge in the summer. If you buy them on sale as a gift, stick them in the freezer to preserve them like new.<br /><br />I am amazed at how good these are and I do pick them up on sale and pop them in the freezer for gifts, and keep them hidden in the fridge as a treat for myself. They are indeed, the best ""other country, Stateside Product"" I have found. Whatever theis company does is amazing because these tender candies stay fresh and edible for those of us here. So, I highly Recommend them as they are my favorites. I would NOT order them in the summer or when it starts to get warmish at all as they will probably melt in transit unless they are shipped in dry ice, which I do not know. But I only have them shipped in the dead of winter because it can get so warm here at any time.<br /><br />So, If you are a candy eater, and love foreighn chocolates, then get some of these. They are a wonderful treat. I hope you like them as well as I do.!"

But after TASTING these yummy morsels, we knew that these were the BEST chocolate ANYWHERE -- on sale, or not!<br /><br />A few years later, my sister came to visit.  We bought some more Gulian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. (don't remember if they were on sale then or not), in honour of her visit.  She took ONE bite of one....and summed up what my mom and I had thought ever since WE had first tasted them:<br /><br />  ""...I can't believe how good they are!""<br /><br />.......................................................<br /><br />THE REAL REASONS WHY THESE CHOCOLATES ARE S_O GOOD Dept.<br /><br />Many years after her visit, I was watching The History Channel, and they mentioned Belgian chocolate, and showing how it was made.  I remember the voice-over saying that Belgian chocolate is even better than French chocolate -- and giving the reasons for this.<br />1) Belgian chocolates are made from the freshest of the most fresh ingredients.  2) Belgian chocolates are made by people who take IMMENSE PRIDE in their profession, and want to make sure everything is JUST right!<br /><br />.....................................................<br /><br />FALSE ECONOMY.....DON'T GET STUCK LIKE I DID!! Dept.<br /><br />I recently made the mistake of trying to find a ""Belgian Chocolate Bargain"" on Amazon.  Believe it or not, it was an 11-pound BLOCK of Dark Belgian chocolate.  WORST culinary mistake I ever bought, (I won't mention my home-made kitchen disasters here.) The greater the cocoa content, the harder the chocolate, you see.  I don't know if it was mentioned or not....but I probably would have bought this anyway, so delighted am I with BELGIAN chocolate.  I wound up with something SO huge, and SO hard, that I was lucky a friend of mine's husband was able to break it into twelve smaller blocks -- with his home-workshop SAW!  He didn't dare break it into slices, because this could have BROKEN his saw!  So I am left with 12 blocks of approximately 1 1/2"" x 2"" x 3"", that I will probaby have to grate, then powder in my blender.  IF, that is, I don't get disgusted enough to throw the whole thing out.  Sadly, these hard BLOCKS of Belgian chocolate are no longer fresh....or that tasty, either..........<br /><br />...................................................<br /><br />THE ( YUMMY! ) BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />So, for a treat, DON'T look for a super-bargain....even in Belgian Chocolates.  Save money by fore-swearing pizza for a few months, or other such economies.  GUYLIAN BELGIAN CHOCOLATE SEA-SHELLS, (here in the 8.82 ounce ""REGULAR economy"" pack), offers bite-size morsels of true confectionary ART!  They are better than ANY chocolate you have ever tasted -- unless you have tasted Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea-Shells before!  Give them to anyone you appreciate and admire....including yourself.  And you, (or whomever you give them to), will surely echo my sister's words:<br /><br />  "".....I can't believe how good they are!"""

Guylian shells are definitely not something you'll confuse with fresh Belgian pralines.  I'm assuming the freshness issue accounts for the difference in taste between these and something like Corne Toison D'Or in Brussels, or any one of the really good Belgian chocolate-makers whose products are flown here from Belgium and sold immediately or disposed of so that customers only get freshly-made chocolates.<br /><br />Providing one understands these are made economically to survive on the shelf, and are not to be compared to the amazing, delectable but quickly-spoiled types for which one either goes to Brussels or pays a fortune in shipping, I think these make a great, relatively inexpensive chocolate."

The oil is not at all like the seller/manufacturer had described it to be. Doesn't smell or tastes like Hass avocados. Hardly. Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.<br /><br />Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again. Besides selling me a bad product, they make me responsible for shipping costs. So that means that instead of the $21.97 reimbursement,  I will only be credited $11.99 and they would not do so unless I ship them back the product which I had to pay $5.  to get it back to them.

I have no idea why I didn't hop on this avocado oil train long ago but I just discovered it at Whole Foods.  This takes salads and meals to a whole other taste level.<br /><br />I try to have a monounsaturated fat at every meal due to the health benefits and the scores of studies as well as personal experience showing they assist in weight loss when combined with a regular proper calorie diet. (These are the good fats) so I include lots of avocados and olive oil in my diet naturally....I'll make salads, pastas, hummus, tapanades for sandwiches, combine beans and corn with avocados etc, make a california veggie burger cooked in olive oil and topped with avocados, red peppers, etc in a pita...so replacing my olive oil with avocado oil has brought on wonderful new flavors.<br /><br />That said, with culinary training under my belt, I'm exceptional at picking out individual flavors in foods and I taste olive oil as a component here as well.  This is made by olivado which I'm assuming is likely an olive oil company by the name so it could simply be they are using the same presses to press out the avocados.  It isn't something that bothers me as I love olive oil, but it gives the avocado flavor a milder taste so I'm anxious to try some other brands as well.<br /><br />I personally feel this is an oil everyone should have on hand.  The flavor is a whole new depth when using oil that is unique and unexpected and I'll always have some, no matter what brand, in my own cabinet. I find myself reaching for this to replace other oils in recipes very often."

Once added to the tarka (tempering)along with a few other spices, these leaves immediately give off a strong yet aromatic citrus like aroma. Although most commonly used in curries, leaves from the curry tree can be used in many other dishes to add flavor. In Cambodia, Khmer toast the leaves in open flame or roasted it to a crunch and crushed it into a soured soup dish called Maju Krueng. These leaves are NOT related to curry powder and you should purchase these fresh not dried for the best flavor for your dishes. Although it is nit advised to store these in the refrigerator, I have found that if wrapped properly in several paper towels then placed in a ziploc bag, they do last for a few days and up to a week.

Price is high and 1 can lasts only 4 days.  Manufactured in England.  Comparable American made product called Elecare, just as good, slightly better price, but if you go to the Neocate manufacterer website and call their customer service you can request your first sample can free.  Good product for infants with milk protien allergies.  We were concerned about strange colored soiled diaper and pediatrician tested it and came up positive for blood in stool.  Doc started us on elemental formulas first.  Two are widely available.  Similac Alimentum and Enfamil Nutramigen.  Enfamil adds DHA to their formula in an attempt to make it more comparable to breast milk but our infant couldn't digest it and passed it as a thick yellow paste.  If you sign up at Similac website they will mail you samples of their other formulas but also several coupons for $5 off any of their formulas which really helped offset the cost.  Be prepared though.  All of these smell horrid and taste nasty as a powder, not as bad once mixed with water.  Fortunately infant tastebuds are not as developed. Baby still had a lot of reflux and gas even when we tried adding every colic remedy/gripe water on the market, which also drove up our feeding costs.  Pediatrician warned these rememdies are good for occassinal not chronic use.  So we stepped up to the Neocate.  After making my first purchase on Amazon, I got bolder and started poking around ebay.  Occasionally finding a better price but be sure to check shipping charges.  Some people make it look like they are selling it cheaper and jack up their shipping charges .  And there is all the drama, bidding wars and you can get sucked in just like in gambling so set your price point and stick to it.  A newer better offer is born daily. Sellers are not as reliable as Amazon and don't always package product well enough to prevent cans from denting.

As the sweltering East Coast heat and humidity approaches, potassium helps with the fluid you lose. Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out.

Really light flavor, refreshing, perfect bit of citrus.  I decided to try a different flavor, so I bought a 12-pack of the Peach & Mango.

I cannot articulate the taste because it's so uniquely bad - you will have to try it for yourself (which I don't recommend).  I was able to drink half of one container before pouring the rest out in disgust.  Reminds me of when I was a teenager and I was forcing down my first mixed alcoholic drink and the taste was nearly unbearable.  I had my friend try a container and his was awful, too.  I eventually threw out the remaining 9 cartons (note: I used a 3rd one to trick another friend into trying this repugnant crap as a gag).<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch or if this is how Peach & Mango is supposed to taste but I am thoroughly dissatisfied.<br /><br />Update: it's been months since I wrote this review and I stand by it.

Honestly, it's one of the worst beverages I've ever tasted - period - next to a can of unsweetened Oolong tea I purchased at Wegman's.

This bread is great and also makes a fantastic pizza crust, it doesn't have the strong aftertaste that some of the GF breads have.  I've never used a breadmaker, always make it by hand, I wear latex gloves to mix it so my hands don't get gluey, I follow the instructions exactly, and it has come out fine every time.  I preheat/warm the oven to 150 or so degrees for 5-10 mins before I start the dough, then shut off the oven.  Spray Pam in the bowl and on top of the dough, cover the bowl and dough with a wet towel, and let it rise in warmed oven.  After risen an hour I then wear gloves again, cover a pizza pan with E.V. flavored olive oil, and spread the dough as thin as possible in the pan because it will rise when baked.  If anyone would like to see what the final pizza looks like I have it posted on Facebook under Gluten free Professionals group.  I also freeze unused dough, take it out the night before, and it makes great bread, rolls, or pizza and the dough is even more workable when it's cold.  Been using Schar for years without a problem, I have a feeling the folks had trouble due to the breadmakers, I work the dough by hand with gloves and it only takes a few minutes.  Remember the ingredients need to be lukewarm for the yeast.  I also plan to make onion bread and maybe olive bread with the Schar mix.  I have also make a spinach pie roll with this dough, spread it out, layer sauted fresh spinach and pepperoni and provolone cheese, roll it up, and bake, it's great.  I have also made sauted Calzones, and fried dough (doughboys) which are fantastic with a bit of sugar, just saute in a bit of olive oil in a nonstick pan and the dough fluffs up great and they taste fantastic.

I bought this for her based on the 3 reviews written here.  There are instructions for using this mix in a bread machine.  I have tried twice to make this bread in my machince following to the letter the directions on the box.  The bread turns out with a tough crust and a very rubber like texture. My wife said she felt like she was trying to eat an old rubber rain boot. Maybe I did something wrong but from now on  I will stick with gluten free pantry or using my own from scratch bread.

After many unsuccessful attempts to recreate my favorite bread recipes using mixtures of various flour types, I decided to go the boxed route to see how things stacked up. Schar products have me hooked! I made the white bread last night and it turned out better than any of the others we've tried and don't come across as too heavy on any one type of flour. I do not recommend using a bread machine for the mix. Why? It's a simple matter to throw the ingredients in a mixer and they don't require any fancy treatment. Pat the batter into a greased and floured loaf pan, stick it someplace warm with a wet towel over it and wait. That's probably the most important thing... It doesn't give a time on the box, it just says ""until doubled"". Give it time... Took over an hour for me, but it was a bit cooler in the house than it probably would have liked. Baked it for exactly the time mentioned on the box and placed the loaf pan on a cookie sheet filled with water. Loaf came out looking like it might be under-cooked, but it wasn't! Came out perfect, works for toast, french toast, sandwiches, etc... Love it! Buying my first five pack through Amazon now!"

247,B001FA1LF2,A2NCQBZ51UCV1S,Molly's & Kate's Momma,0,0,5,1298937600,Pretty Darn Good GF Bread + Recipe Adaptations,"I am really happy with this bread. The bread gets a nice crust and pretty good flavor.<br /><br />When I make my bread, I'm more successful in the oven rather than the bread maker.  It's absolutely key that you put a pyrex of water in the rack under the bread pan when you bake this bread - otherwise you get a pretty tough and dry crust.  Be sure to put the pyrex in the oven when you preheat the oven. That way when the bread dough goes in, the oven is already humid.  Obviously you can't do that in the bread maker - so oven is the only way to go.<br /><br />I have also found that adding an extra 1/2 cup of water gives the bread a bit more volume.  I also add 2 tbls of honey - this is not much in terms of sweetness, but it does mellow out any unusual flavors that are always found in GF bread.<br /><br />If you're new to GF, this a great bread to try."

I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!<br /><br />The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.  And the longer you cook it, the more rock-hard it gets.  I missed crunchy dough though since going gf, so I don't mind it slightly over-cooked."

Believe me, it would have to be for me to make it!<br /><br />It's pretty good following the package directions, but what really made it fantastic was adding a full additional cup of water to the recipe, as recommended by one of the other reviewers. (This brings the total to 3 cups of water.)<br /><br />Following the package directions, you really need to eat this bread the day you bake it (so make sure you make it in the morning!). Fortunately, this has not been a problem at my house. Adding the extra cup of water, it was still edible the next day.<br /><br />I did put the bread in the oven to rise for 30 minutes, with the oven temperature set at ""warm"".<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Since writing the above, I purchased a bread machine. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067REBU"">Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker</a><br /><br />After 5 or 6 trial-and-error attempts, all moderately successful, I have cracked the code to making this bread mix work optimally in this machine. Here it is:<br /><br />Instead of putting the wet ingredients in first (as the machine's booklet instructs), put the DRY ingredients in first, then the wet ingredients. Use the settings:<br /><br />1 Basic<br />1 1/2 pound loaf<br />Dark crust<br /><br />While following the directions (of the machine) will work, following my directions leads to bread that rises half again as high. This yields a fluffier texture which, frankly, tastes less gluten-free. (You know what I'm talking about!) The individual slices of bread are then so huge that you can literally cut one in half and make a decent-size PBJ."

After 3 days sitting at room temperature, still good, but drying slightly (no crumbling) - after 3 more days in the refrigerator, tastes like a good chewy English muffin, toasted, and STILL no crumbling.

Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.<br /><br />Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.<br /><br />I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.<br /><br />Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?

They're sweet, slightly tart, and fried--what can be better?  As you've seen from other reviewers, it's easy to eat a whole bag in one sitting.  They taste great, because they're cooked in oil and does have a little less fat than potato chips.<br /><br />Besides the ""non-healthiness"" of it, the box of 12 arrived at my door completely beaten up.  The package tape was unraveling and the box looked like it had just come back from a war zone--slightly smooshed and tearing at the seams.  There are no buffers or packaging materials in the box, with only the apple chip bags in there.  Thus, half of my chips were really just crumbs.<br /><br />I bought one bag in the store and there were quite a few crumbs in there too.  I wish the chips came more whole.  I'm not sure what everyone else's shipping experience was like, but I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Update: I've since purchased another couple of boxes and Amazon has placed the original apple chip boxes into an Amazon.com boxes.

Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now?  I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season.

That said, I can give this sauce 3 out of 5 stars as a mediocre curry dinner base, and 0 out of 5 stars as a packing material.  Don't expect it to taste like a restaurant's curry: it's more of a ketchup with curry added.  Also, be careful of broken glass when disposing of said packing material.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if half of the jars you ordered shattered en route, because the mixture of cardboard and three square inches of bubble wrap don't quite get the job done.

If you have time to savor a delicate, refreshing brew then try this!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 5 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. This tea is reported as having a high level of antioxidants-higher than green tea. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface. Here is a poem they put on this box:<br /><br />""Ten thousand flowers in the spring, the moon in autumn, a cool breeze in summer, snow in winter.
